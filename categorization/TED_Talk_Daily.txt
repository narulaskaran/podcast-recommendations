With clarity and insight, economist and author William "Sandy" Darity discusses how the grievous injustice of slavery in the US led to the immense wealth gap that currently exists between Black and white Americans. He explains how reparations for descendants of enslaved people would work  and why it's necessary that the US engage in this act of compensation and redemption to make progress towards true equality. "We've been promised a future of chrome  but what if the future is fleshy?" asks biological designer Christina Agapakis. In this awe-inspiring talk, Agapakis details her work in synthetic biology  a multidisciplinary area of research that pokes holes in the line between what's natural and artificial  and shares how breaking down the boundaries between science, society, nature and technology can lead us to imagine different possible futures. In a breathtaking, jazz-inflected spoken-word performance, TED Fellow Marc Bamuthi Joseph shares a Black father's tender and wrenching internal reflection on the pride and terror of seeing his son enter adulthood.
