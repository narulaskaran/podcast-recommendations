            "transcript": "Hello friends and welcome to the show this episode, the podcast  If you're not ready, switch debit cards, you don't have to with the cat  cash app will also send ten dollars to support our good friend, justin wren's fight for the forgotten charity,  love me undies.

There's no contract, no hidden fees or fine print and simply safe, has won a ton of awards from psi net to the new york times.  or you go to simply save dot com, slash rogan, so that they know that this show sent you.  Absolutely it's! You shouldn't even call them a debate. What they are is a um. You know reality tv show in which you have to come up with a sound bite. No that stuff it is the meaning that's the meaning, to the candidates and it's the meaning to the american people. You can't explain the complexity,  on the stage, what do you do, but there are other ways that we've got to do it because the issues facing this country are so enormous and in some cases so complicated. Nobody in the world can honestly explain them in forty five seconds and then that what encourages people to do is to come up with sound bites to do absurd things. If I yelled in scream on the show I took my clothes off, it would get a lot of publicity right. Yeah  they. These are a long conversations, but it takes us to another issue and that as a nation, we do a pretty bad job in analyzing and discussing the serious issues facing our country, and I I hold the media to some degree responsible for that. You know other countries what they do is the job you want to run for president,  a chunk of their time and then pled his case, but you know what goes on in other countries. You don't have to buy that time. What the obligation is, if you are a network you're going to make that I'm free and available to canton.  can do online like you can do right here right now. You can't get that on television. What  annoying to you? Yes, it is, of course it is  I don't think it is it's not, and the truth is we are the only major country on earth. Many people don't know this. We're the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right, and yet we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care the function, and you can argument with me if you want, but the function of the current health care system is not to provide quality capable it is to make tens of billions of dollars in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. That's the function. If you go to canada and I live fifty miles away from the canadian border, you have major heart surgery, you're in the hospital for a month. Do you know what the bill is when you get out zero? You got it. You got any doctor, you want, you don't have to take out your wallet,  yet they guarantee health care all of their people and they spend one slash two of what we spend that's kind of what I want to go, and I don't think that that's terribly radical. We have a program now, which everybody knows it's called medicare was started by lyndon johnson back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five. It is a popular program. All that I want to go over a four year period is to expand the today eligibility age is sixty five want to take it out of fifty five. Forty five, thirty five everybody over four year period. That's about it and I want to expand benefits to include a dental care.  It's a high classes as well. That's about it not too radical, but that doesn't some alcohol. Now when you say that the the tenor spends less. Obviously they have less people, you mean less per capita as path per capita and in the quality of care is as good or better do. They have problems yeah their problems. Everybody has problems, but overall the health care experts will tell you the quality of care. There is as good or better than it is in our country. So what's the hurdle? Okay, I'll, tell you exactly what her last hurdle is exactly the same thing is in every other aspect of our lives. It's the power of money, art! Listen to this over the last twenty years. The drug companies alone have spent four and a half billion dollars in twenty years.  On lobbying and campaign contributions, that's what we're up against the knowledge- and I mark my words within a short period of time. You will see tv ads, california, all over this country, demonizing bernie sanders. He wants to do this terrible thing to you. He wants to do that. They have  and drugs in california may recall that effort. It was a ballot item in one state here in california. Do you know how much the drug companies alone spent a defeat that they spent one hundred and thirty one dollars million on one ballot item in one state all right? Last year the top ten drug companies made sixty nine dollars billion. A week ago I went to canada with a number of americans who are dealing with diabetes. We bought insulin in windsor ontario for one slash, ten, the price ten percent of the same exact product being charged in america. So you got a drug company,  not to go shooting and such is this something that can really be implemented inside of four years yeah.  nineteen million people signed up with the technology that is way way behind. Where we are today, why can't we over a4 year period simply expand that program? I don't think it's such a a difficult op.  in general, when people talk about lobbyists and it's it's a an unattractive term. We we think a bit in terms of a negative. We don't we don't think of all thank others lobbyists.  yeah the tour and only d'oh d'oh. Today, in america you got three people owning more wealth in the bottom half of the american society. You don't see that on television too much of you, no, you don't three people. You got the top one percent owning more wealth than the bottom. Ninety two percent- listen to this. This is a statistic we recently saw came from the federal reserve over the last thirty years. The top one percent has seen a twenty one dollars trillion increase  in their wealth. The bottom half of america seen a nine hundred dollars billion decline in their wealth. So what you have in america today is a relatively small number of incredibly wealthy people, and I deal with these guys every day. People are always talking about rich. You don't know what riches, what multibillion dollar operations off incredible power over our society, and if you want a pharmaceutical industry, and last year ten companies made sixty nine dollars billion in profit. You're sitting around right now saying all right, that's  sure that they make as much as I can profit, but it's not any different with wall street, it's not any different with the fossil fuel industry or the prison industrial complex. These guys have wealth, they have power and they could care less about the needs of working people in this country, and that's the dynamic of american politics.  spend their money, you know they will tell you that all of them want to research and develop were charged with tackling cancer with tackling diabetes, alzheimer's. The truth is, of course they are, but the bulk off their money is going off into what we call the meat too  stop that, when you're dealing with this kind of influence that you talked about with sixty nine dollars billion in a year I mean the resource? Is they have? How would you stop that? Well, that is kind of what we call the sixty four thousand questions, yeah and I'll. Tell you what I think this is what I believe if you think back on american history and you think about the real changes that have taken place in society. You think about the labor movement and working class people standing up and saying to their employers, we're not gonna, be treated like animals anymore, you can't hire and virus. You can't work us, you know fifteen hours a day, we deserve dignity and you think about the growth of the labor movement of millions of people, beginning to slam together and fight you think about the civil rights movement. You know and  wasn't just dr martin luther king jr was again millions of african americans and white allies say we're going to end segregation and racism in this country about about the women's movement. A hundred years ago, women in america didn't even have the right to vote. Think about the gay rights movement think about the environmental. The only way the change takes place is when ordinary people come together and stand up and fight and say that the status quo is not working and that's what I believe and that's what we're trying to do so with the message of  unless millions of people were working with me to tell the corporate elite that they cannot get it all. So how would that be implemented? Let's say you become president you're gonna become president. You think we're gonna shut it a shot. President bernie. What do you do you get in there? What do you do? First of all, you make a very clear you make it clear to the american people what your agenda is, and I appreciate the opportunity to talk about an agenda and  or are the most important years for human, intellectual and emotional development right. Every psychologist will tell you that, and yet we have a totally dysfunctional early childhood system. You pay. We pay our child  These are issues that we have to deal with and I will deal with him and we are gonna substantially improve the quality of education. America, we're gonna, cancel student debt by imposing a tax on wall street speculation. All right, so you gotta deal with education. You've got to deal with climate change, you know the truth is that donald trump is that wrong. Climate change is not a hoax. It is a very, very dangerous reality for our country and the rest of the world signed. This tell us we have less than twelve years to transformer and  if you all going to oppose raising the minimum wage to at least fifteen dollars an hour. I will be in kentucky as president of the united states and we're going to have a rally because you're going to have  pay fifteen dollars an hour to people like that to the entry level, people that they won't be able to stay open well, first of all, they will be competing against. You know if your business number business and both of us to raise our wages at the same level, we both have the same burden. So what's it brett spread across.  kids. These are people in their 30s. These. These are ordinary adults who cannot make it on one thousand two hundred and thirteen dollars an hour. So I think the arg  California, all over this country, is rising fairly rapidly. People can't afford health care can't afford college. I don't think it's asking our employers too much to pay at least fifteen miles an hour minimum itch  loot our water, our air, our environment. It's also not the panty taxes come trump campaign. As I recall he said,  This is their agenda. Their agenda was to cut social security, medicare and medicaid and to do away with all corporate texas. So what you have right now, that's that's what greed is about. They want it all. So, as you indicated, you have a company like amazon owned by jeff bezos, who happens to be the wealthiest guy in america worth about one hundred and fifty billion amazon paid zero in federal income taxes, and it's not just them. Dozens of corporations paid nothing or very, very little  here you're touching now on the heart and soul of the tragedy of american politics,  I'm worried about the deficit, so you make it  social security checks garnish right now, it's ten to twenty years. It's some places, it's literally a lifetime. Now,  own home. You could send your kids to school. You lived a pretty good life made it in the middle class, forty or fifty years later. There's an explosion of technology, there's a growth in unfettered free trade, and it is clear now that most people to make it into the middle class are gonna need a higher education. That's college, or maybe it's technical training in water  world has changed and high school degree is not good enough anymore, so expand that concept through college now guess what  in terms of the cancellation of debt, which is my view. You got forty five million people arm who I  cities, tuition, free, cancel student debt in this country that will cost two dot. Two trillion dollars a lot of money over a ten year period. We do this through a tax on wall street speculation, which will bring in two dot four tr.  job that would that would raise more than enough money. It's a very small town.  upped. Most of those things are resolved, but not student loans, a man again. This looks through the and that has to do with bankruptcy law, which was passed against my vote on. While you were on bankruptcy- and I should have mentioned this before when you talk about the health care system- one slash, two: a million americans every single year go bankrupt because off medical bill simply can't pay, but right.  they can't in many cases, get married and have kids. They certainly can't buy a home the camp by a call there really crushed by this debt, and what was the crime? What did they do? They try to get a higher education, a  All these people that want action, but nobody knows exactly what to do. There's calls for gun control. This calls for mental health reform. Health calls there's calls what, if anything, can be done to stop these things from happening, and how have you sat down  such a horrific situation. You know we were in a way had a town meeting we're in a batter actually in las vegas when el paso happened- and we didn't tell me- and I said, let's take a moment of silence- to remember the victims and pray for the survivors literally the next day- another part of las vegas. I have to do it again and I said I can't believe that just yesterday we did this and I have to do it again. This is, I don't know what the words my friend baidoa rock would say that you don't know what words. What can you say? It happens again and again, who can imagine some lunatic walking into a school or a mall, we're just on a nightclub area taken out of the assault, weapon and shooting people, and that we almost become to accept this is a normal part of american life. Is  incredible, is just totally demoralizing all right. So here's what I think, there's no magical answer and but let me tell you what I think. First of all, this is the reality. The reality is that today, as we speak, there are approximately four hundred million guns in america. Today we have more guns than we have people we have between five to ten million assault weapons and an assault. Weapon, as you know, is a military style weapon designed to kill human beings kind of rapidly. So that's and then on top of that we have again nothing to be proud off, but you know we have a number off mentally unstable people, people  all these ideas, but here's some of what we have to do. First will, if you want to own a gun in america you have got to. We have got to know that you are a stable person, and that means that we need to expand of it it it it the background checks the currently exist. Okay, so we got to know. Did you beat up your wife? Have you committed crimes of it's a treat such? What is the state to be mental health up number two will make that universal number two  can today legally walk into a gun, show up past the background check and buy a dozen guns, walk out and sell them to criminal elements who will use them for bad things.  assault weapons in this country. That's my deal period. S o, I believe, in a ban on a stolen that I think we have got to begin thinking about when we have five to ten million assault weapons, which is more than the u s military has we have to think about it,  into our bill of rights is written into our the the the the the way we the what where this country was founded. It's the second amendment.  right. Ninety nine point: nine percent of gun owners would never, in a million billion years, think of doing these horrible things. But in the moment that we are living in a, but I think that we're all going to have to make some concessions to the reality of what is going on, and that is that there is a small number of.  I agree. We are living a terrible situation, I mean there's hundreds of mass shootings a year now, which is insane and if you look at the number in comparison to the rest of the world, it's crazy, like a big one in other countries like three mass shootings in a year we had more than two hundred and seventy it's it's crazy. But how would you implement something like this? Well, the idea of banning assault weapons has been done in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four, we banned assault weapons. I believe I believe it was for ten years of  that ben was undone by republican majority uh and it didn't you know, I'm not suggesting by the way than anything here that if you banned assault weapons tomorrow, that will radically change everything, but we have got to do the best that we can do. And again I preface my remarks by telling I don't have a magical solution. You've got hundreds of millions of guns out that you have people who should not be owning these guns who gets set off by god knows what and do terrible things all we can do is the best that we could do. But to say we can't do anything. I think it's a real disservice to the american I'll. Tell you something else that bothers me. You know, in addition to the horror of seeing people lying on, the street dead is what this is doing to the children of this country, and I think we underestimate that I have seven grandchildren and in  for them and for kids all of this country, you're, going to see the falls coming. Kids, going back to school, you're going to see in schools all over america drills all right. This is what you do if somebody walks into the school all right you,  removing these guns from people's homes? I don't think you're going to have the fbi knocking on somebody's doors and taking it. That's not what we do in america. You know if you have four hundred million guns already out there and they're building more every year. Right now, as we speak, gun manufacturers or may  if you are a gun manufacturer and you are selling a hell of a lot of guns to a gun  amphetamines, like adderall and prozac, and all this different stuff that has varied effects on the human brain. What could be done? What  And now I am- and I could understand this perfectly- I'm seeing dayton and I'm seeing watching television, el paso and I'm getting a p t p s ptsd reaction, all right, that's totally. If you were in a place where people were shot down and I'm trying to get counseling,  ford and on medicare medicare would be free. So that's the  including this one. What do you think could be done and what should be done to have this across the especially federal?  possible law abiding person should be able to consume uhm. Let me say this when I ran for president's with the democratic nomination in two thousand and sixteen I talked about a broken criminal justice system which ends up having in the united states more people in jail than any other country. We have more people in jail in china does, which is a car  executive order, water, and I will do that. Second of all, we have now is number  thing to do. You know we can argue about the pluses and minuses, I'm not a great fan of drugs. Other people smoke marijuana a couple of times didn't do much for me. Other people, I guess, have different in just a couple times.  you're touching on a real tragedy. Yes, and when we talk about criminal justice in america, we have over two million people in jail. They are disproportionately african american, latino and native american and here's what I think I think in the wealthiest country,  It makes so much more sense from a humane perspective. Protecting our people,  even the reduced, the all those things sound great the uncomfortable reality about drugs, though, is that when drugs are illegal, criminal, seldom and there's, obviously a need for drugs in terms of not necessarily need, but uh. A demand for drugs is a demand for drugs in this country. That's absolutely fueling mac,  not to know what your heart tells. That's the pharmaceutical industry right. What do the heroin is? Legal, yes, art now you're asking this is a very, very deep question, which we don't talk about terribly much. Why is it that so many of our people are turning to drugs to alcohol by the way- and I don't mean to drink tonight, but I mean serious alcohol problems  And the job you used to have earning a decent living  It means that we have to have a great educational system and people  up some of the demand for these these illegal. I believe that is the case. Look if I am optimistic. If I'm excited about going to work tomorrow and I'm seeing my kid doing great in school- and you know, when I get sick, I can't go to the doctor's office and have a sense of community. My downtown is not all bordered up, because businesses have left, but we have. We have a community yeah, like the strong likelihood is there will be less diseases of this  like there is an out that they do have an opportunity, and  miles long! Isn't that great? Your point is that we have to. I think, as I understand what you're saying we have to read to find what being a great nation is about. We are not a great nation when we have forty million people living in poverty  with the goal of shutting down plants in this country and moving abroad, and the result of that has been the loss of millions of good paying jobs and the the complete destruction of communal  the control or at least of the direction of the one person who winds up becoming the president united states. Is it impossible?  any sane president operates is you need to be working with the smartest men and women from all walks of life who understand the search. Every issue we have touched on joe is enormously complicated and I can send out a you know, twenty or tweet on it, but that doesn't solve it. So, unlike trump in a, we will bring together of the best and most knowledgeable people in this country to address the housing crisis. To address the issue of of these diseases of the spare, we don't even touch on climate change. You know, and in the future of the planet, had a week  Duration, unlike trumps, is not gonna be filled with billion as who's. You know, basically very often greedy type people. It is going to be filled with the best people from from the working class itself from the trade union movement people who are going to help us create policies that work for workers  resident that can somehow another slow down this this process? First of all, we have to have a president who, unlike trump beliefs and science, that I do and what the scientists are telling us that mention early is that we have fewer than twelve years the transformer energy system, or else there will be irreparable damage done not only child country but to the world. Now. Climate change is not just an american issue, so we could do tomorrow, all the right things, but of china and russia and india and the rest of the brazil and africa does not do the right thing. You know we're not gonna make the progress we need. So  here is what we have to do. In my view, number one we have to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short term profits and they make a whole lot of money. They're short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. I don't think that's a hard sell to make. You cannot keep producing a product which is destroying the planet  probably the strongest bro work a record of any member of the congress. So it is not my intention to throw these guys out on the and women out on the street and ignore the pain that they will go through. We are proposing billions of dollars to rebuild those communities and make sure that those guys and women get new jobs, so we're not just discarding people in the fossil fuel industry, but ultimately the product that they're producing, which is now carbon emissions, is destroying the planet. So we have to move away from fossil  aggressively to sustainable energies like wind and solar in california. Doing a good job with win die  well these these ideas sound great, but in the competitive environment of global politics. How would you convince russia or china or any of these countries to do something that would put  we're faced with a war in the east with china, a war in the west in europe with hitler.  and see the world with dissent from  deals in europe.

So, even if you can solve that the data rate issue in Europe, especially upward but and for two, then you can improve  you arrangements, a lot effort, compressing complex concept into words, and this does little alot. Alas, information last that occurs when compressing  words and in different ways and depend upon tone depend.  where you know what a person saying and you can tell them what you are saying  Would the Sherwood haven't language, but you gotta let what their situation I daresay you would be able to just if we collect the matrix you you want to speak an evaluation of all right. I swear it worth dollar the program right, so  that sounds like that. Don't don't worry, that does not mean a sneak of any there's. Does this I'll take a well how many years before you have to talk, if the? If, if the development continues to accelerate, then maybe five year,  is or ancient hominid to us. What's the difference less here,  modification of perspective. Probably but yeah I mean you, you could save state and restore that state into biological being, if you, if you want to do in future in principle, is like knowing like four  videos on your phone is open away. You could remember video right as accurately as your phone or a camera you know could so I now, if you got like it, some some yet  Percent, there's no way to sign a probability with accuracy here right, but roughly, if you just had a just got instinct.  To know that this experience, somehow another doesn't exist in a material form, they can knock on film  There are currently changing your state with love and oxytocin and and beauty changes,  where's my consciousness? What's the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen in here right, Wendy  Otto relationships, artificial intelligence, it we'll be unrecognizable that one day will be so  some sort of a direction where you trying to improve things you're out  and you have some my skull cap in place of the top. Your head and interfacing, with the  someone if someone exogamy a quote a great quote by a wise person? Mace excited  but I hope we will gain whether yeah. That's the thing right gaining more than we lose something it makes us interesting. Is that we're so flawed suffer sure electors obligation through the ages  viral immunity so that that's swell  viral inner idea, since that is  See we're smart, but though the minister a capitalist society, you know you could, it seems, like you can run  as like earth? Cybernetic collective, that's far smarter than in individual, like I can personally bold like a whole rocket and Andy engines and watch it and everything that's impossible, but we have eight thousand people space action by piecing it out to different people and using like computers and machines, and so we can make less Rockets launched orbit talk of the space station that anything, so that already exists where this in a way this.  heavy I be vastly beyond us, and DE coupled from human will decouple from whom. So this is that, if you can't be them, join them  can, like the animal brain, reptile brain K list for items it. It's like alembic system, basically gothic, the cortex. The brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you ve got the primitive rain and you got the sort of fur smart brain or that the rain is capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey Kanner said now the book your cortex  much much smarter than you have existed. Nonetheless, they worked gather well, so I've met anyone who wants to lead the loving system or the cortex, the repeal of quite happy having both so near, but that this is being that, like the computer, the eyes it is like a third layer, tertiary lair, so that is like that could be symbolic with the cortex it we much smarter than the cortex, but you'd procession have three letters and an you actually have that right now, your phone is capable of things a yoke, fewer escape of things that your brain is definitely not storing. Terabytes of information perfectly doing incredible calculations that we condemn come close to doing you have that  your computer is just like, I said, the data rate is slow. The connection is weak, wizened, so disconcerting a wiser. Why does it not give me comfort to think about  You know if you use Google voice or lax, or one of the things it using a neural net, to decode your speech and to understand what you're saying, if twenty image recognition or improve the Claudia photograph, it's it's using been near. That's the best way to do that,  How do we make sure works? We tried on prisoners like when you do not know if we take rapists, cut holes and have now accept if somebody's gotta search, brain injury rat and though there live like very severe brain injuries than and then you can fix those flows. Brain agrees, and you know that you prove out there.  Link that says actually that that there would be almost everyone would find a need at some point. If you get old love to use your own your leg and and and then a psycho cancer, we can improve the functionality and improve the invitations communication speed. So then you will not have to use your thumbs to committee with computer.  can a sneak up any others like getting up the approval for staff has not like overnight, and this is an appropriate, had fairly version terrorism before you know it, it would realistically be.  What are we gonna be like when twenty or twenty five  If you're a extension of yourself? What does that mean to you? But when you, when you say I extension of yourself? Well, you like said you already have a computer extension of yourself in the moon  It would just be that that more of you would be in the cloud I guess than in your body or if that more of you well  there's so much conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed.  So it's like watching the same movie again, but in English, so yeah.  Yeah. If you, if you're you, can look at the immortality statistics by age and whether they have come, what will come of it? It is likely that, like based existing conditions and age and if you're below, sixty and and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low besides era, but is extremely low,  quite crazy, but in some places a panic is deserved right like if we only I see you in Manhattan and people are dying, left and right, never ones on innovators and its eight  It's like you, have a bow heart disease, yarn and Unita Triple bypass, it's like sort of elective, but if you don't get it done in time, it's you gonna die yeah, it's collectives where work  still dangerous to worsen the flu, but not as bad as we thought, or we feared it could be  they homework. Where mask? Does yes not get you back to do them, Japan, that's like normal. If you're, if you're ale, you you were faced masking carve on people, I think that that would be a great thing to turn off in general  yes, and I think this has shaken up the the system as such must accept what moribund with. Let lays layers of bureaucracy, and I think that you have countries on that bureaucracy and if we have some point, the probably will be a pandemic with with a with it for the high mortality rate.  killing large numbers of young, healthy people that that's you to find. That is like a high mortality than that that this is at least practice were suddenly ban, and I think this has given a steamer maritime that there will be eventually some some such  the pandemic and much more money that goes to funding treatments and in some preventative measures. Yeah absolutely- and I think I think this  and attentively. If we act, crackly yeah yeah, the other serve my thinking that there will be some massive Lenihan, America of local, more proof of letting than last year, so that the citizens can like a practice, run for something that that had a reputation in the main, the future have a serious like a really high mortality rate in, and we can. I got to go through this with without without it  did I tell you fuck you doing today by police officers who does that who gets it,  even if it comes your way, even if the shitstorm hits you in the face. You got appreciate why? How amazing isn't that all these people do have the ability to express themselves? We didn't  I want to say that it's almost like you know you hit the button.  You know someone say I'm sending opposing smoke signals. There were few your smokescreen mills, it's like it! So crude  you know I mean where they don't realize with. It is something funny about that for everybody else. There is pre great. What might be the best new source?  combine these faces to minimize one perfect social justice more, but the thing I recognized it early on before I met him that this was parity. This is this is just fun and then I love reading the people. They don't recognize that they get angry and they don't really really there's a lot of people are just get really furious, churn out some of the some fun to that this some fun to the not picking up on the true nature of the site,  distance from iridescent like ok, it's well, it's been fired by,  you're looking for what was going on in the world that it's hard to find some man that isn't it. That's that that's good yeah. You know that  And this is so many variables and you gotta put everything through this filter of, whereas this person coming from  bed himself and that world trying to understand it and to be able to report  right now in California, weren't stage to tomorrow or Friday, two days from now say to retail stores. Opening up things are changing  yes, you know. So it's like that. You got to put a lot of weight on that. Have people a lot of people died to you know when the independence with the country and and fight for the democracy that we have, and you know we should treasure that and not in and not give up our liberties to Beasley. I think we,  really the wrestling people for protesting, because  living their life, the way they did particulate having a career and  man is stop placing money over human lives and  had this absurd like view that the economy is like some magic corn, aplenty like each it just now,  become detached from reality. Do you you can't just legislate money answer and solve these things? If you don't make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously will run out of this.  they did. It turned out to be. Maybe I think briefly briefly briefly, but I think if you know any kind of like sensible examination of what happened in China would reach a conclusion that those up sooner can occur this this virus, retreating into on those like two hundred thousand people a day, leaving one so that that it it it went everywhere very fast through throughout China, throughout the world and even fatality  World Health organisation appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda that the things that american companies have massive supply chains in China by Konrad Tessa, for example, we have hundreds of suppliers like tier one, two three, four suppliers throughout throughout China, so we know if they are able to make stuff or not. We know if they. If they have issues are not, then they had their China's back back at full steam and intel. Many previous ever use company has some significant ever spies in China sooner. You know if there is a will to provide things were not worth. If, as you know, I mean how they read, it has some thousand people in China so WEBS  Zero people died. Ok, so that that's a real statistic: that's coming from yeah! You know yes, people, yet we literally we were in peril. Do you think is a danger of this idea?  this has been criticized in both directions really exerts.  Center was do this publicly and say we were acting  so somewhere, we helpful just add from informational level, is when reporting serve covert cases to separate out diagnosed with covert versus had covered like symptoms, yes, because of the list of of symptoms that could be covered at this point is like a mile, or so it's like a hard to show it all. It's like you could recover. So just just give you a better information. The deafening diagnosed covered or had covered like symptoms were complaining, those two so that one that it looks bigger than it is, then, if somebody  ethically, not that bad, but heart attack strokes. Yet it  in a bind right now that there's a bunch of us preserve their following doctors, as your matching, the other for hospitals have full Europe tart heart against me said I ve got like  So my request is covered. Only if it is some has been tested has receded a father, Pasok, over test not efficient. We have sometimes one of five hundred symptoms and then  is this, because this is  Frankly, I am not sure how you die without those things. No, you  I think the way to break out of sloop is to have clarity of information  Don't don't love but altogether now and if, if, if you give, if your people just parts out the data better clearer, clearer information about like set, was this an actual curve diagnosis or was it or do they get the test test gave a positive or do they just have some sometimes just parts that those two out and then pass out just if somebody died debate I would today for that they even have a covert test were or today,  were covered with. It isn't had we the main course, but with a significant contributor to their death, or was it not a significant contributor to death.  not every sixty one thousand in this country last year, early, five, solar, well and then their cigarettes massacre.  yeah, it's crazy, so smoke. Is it Barbicane long suspected? Is bad news business not not get near? Turning your lungs and smoke smoke? Beef, not great. So  acceptable. Deaths, are weird and that's the way,  disease, whatever they would have lived x, number years. Yeah, you know, sir, you have somebody dies when they're they're there twenty and cut a little eighty.

The race completely after Super Tuesday states.  even as public health officials are urging them and states across the country have taken that drastic step. It was concept in what explains what's happening in Wisconsin, but when most people look at these presidential primaries particular state like was content.

It's not something I wanted to do, and it's not something I'd take lightly and people across the state are starting to say.

The tortoise went, beats the hair, and so the hairs that go to the elite schools that they better slide into tortoise mode, or it's not gonna work out well for them, and the the the tortoises that go to the state schools better stay being a tortoise than stick with it. So let us recap sittings to be  and even as he says, that he can see.  Headquarters of the law. School admissions council.

The information the test? Does we have to do it and will stand as way here we are suggesting is a different approach to these tests and we  only some of them catch up to the hairs, but then what is that done now?

We met him in the previous episode, the former fire fighter from Cleveland who now teaches law at Indiana University. Well, Henderson told me to call a friend of his named Evan Parker. They worked together. I dont know if you ve ever read Michael Louis, his famous  it is one hundred percent puckers young cerebral, very proper in a suit tie briefcase. Is that messing around? I said at the beginning that I was going to offer you a grand, unified theory of how to fix higher education.
