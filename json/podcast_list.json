            "transcript": "hello friends and welcome to the show this episode, the podcast  if you're not ready, switch debit cards, you don't have to with the cat  cash app will also send ten dollars to support our good friend, justin wren's fight for the forgotten charity,  love me undies. they are my absolute all time, favorite underwear and i wear them every day. i do not  in on your body and their offers in sizes, from extra small to four 4xl. the fear ole feel free collection offers an ultra soft waistband that maximizes  free shipping, it's a no brainer, especially because they have a one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteed. who  the resumes to find people to write  but not least, were brought to you by simply safe? according to studies, over ten percent of break ins are planned beforehand. the rest are spur of the moment. crimes of opportunity- in other words  your window and room with twenty four seven professional monitoring and they make it easy on you. there's no contract, no hidden fees or fine print and simply safe, has won a ton of awards from psi net to the new york times.  or you go to simply save dot com, slash rogan, so that they know that this show sent you.  absolutely it's! you shouldn't even call them a debate. what they are is a um. you know reality tv show in which you have to come up with a sound bite. no that stuff it is the meaning that's the meaning, to the candidates and it's the meaning to the american people. you can't explain the complexity,  on the stage, what do you do, but there are other ways that we've got to do it because the issues facing this country are so enormous and in some cases so complicated. nobody in the world can honestly explain them in forty five seconds and then that what encourages people to do is to come up with sound bites to do absurd things. if i yelled in scream on the show i took my clothes off, it would get a lot of publicity right. yeah  they. these are a long conversations, but it takes us to another issue and that as a nation, we do a pretty bad job in analyzing and discussing the serious issues facing our country, and i i hold the media to some degree responsible for that. you know other countries what they do is the job you want to run for president,  a chunk of their time and then pled his case, but you know what goes on in other countries. you don't have to buy that time. what the obligation is, if you are a network you're going to make that i'm free and available to canton.  can do online like you can do right here right now. you can't get that on television. what  annoying to you? yes, it is, of course it is  i don't think it is it's not, and the truth is we are the only major country on earth. many people don't know this. we're the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all people as a human right, and yet we end up spending almost twice as much per capita on health care the function, and you can argument with me if you want, but the function of the current health care system is not to provide quality capable it is to make tens of billions of dollars in profit for the drug companies and the insurance companies. that's the function. if you go to canada and i live fifty miles away from the canadian border, you have major heart surgery, you're in the hospital for a month. do you know what the bill is when you get out zero? you got it. you got any doctor, you want, you don't have to take out your wallet,  yet they guarantee health care all of their people and they spend one slash two of what we spend that's kind of what i want to go, and i don't think that that's terribly radical. we have a program now, which everybody knows it's called medicare was started by lyndon johnson back in one thousand nine hundred and sixty five. it is a popular program. all that i want to go over a four year period is to expand the today eligibility age is sixty five want to take it out of fifty five. forty five, thirty five everybody over four year period. that's about it and i want to expand benefits to include a dental care.  it's a high classes as well. that's about it not too radical, but that doesn't some alcohol. now when you say that the the tenor spends less. obviously they have less people, you mean less per capita as path per capita and in the quality of care is as good or better do. they have problems yeah their problems. everybody has problems, but overall the health care experts will tell you the quality of care. there is as good or better than it is in our country. so what's the hurdle? okay, i'll, tell you exactly what her last hurdle is exactly the same thing is in every other aspect of our lives. it's the power of money, art! listen to this over the last twenty years. the drug companies alone have spent four and a half billion dollars in twenty years.  on lobbying and campaign contributions, that's what we're up against the knowledge- and i mark my words within a short period of time. you will see tv ads, california, all over this country, demonizing bernie sanders. he wants to do this terrible thing to you. he wants to do that. they have  and drugs in california may recall that effort. it was a ballot item in one state here in california. do you know how much the drug companies alone spent a defeat that they spent one hundred and thirty one dollars million on one ballot item in one state all right? last year the top ten drug companies made sixty nine dollars billion. a week ago i went to canada with a number of americans who are dealing with diabetes. we bought insulin in windsor ontario for one slash, ten, the price ten percent of the same exact product being charged in america. so you got a drug company,  not to go shooting and such is this something that can really be implemented inside of four years yeah.  nineteen million people signed up with the technology that is way way behind. where we are today, why can't we over a4 year period simply expand that program? i don't think it's such a a difficult op.  in general, when people talk about lobbyists and it's it's a an unattractive term. we we think a bit in terms of a negative. we don't we don't think of all thank others lobbyists.  yeah the tour and only d'oh d'oh. today, in america you got three people owning more wealth in the bottom half of the american society. you don't see that on television too much of you, no, you don't three people. you got the top one percent owning more wealth than the bottom. ninety two percent- listen to this. this is a statistic we recently saw came from the federal reserve over the last thirty years. the top one percent has seen a twenty one dollars trillion increase  in their wealth. the bottom half of america seen a nine hundred dollars billion decline in their wealth. so what you have in america today is a relatively small number of incredibly wealthy people, and i deal with these guys every day. people are always talking about rich. you don't know what riches, what multibillion dollar operations off incredible power over our society, and if you want a pharmaceutical industry, and last year ten companies made sixty nine dollars billion in profit. you're sitting around right now saying all right, that's  sure that they make as much as i can profit, but it's not any different with wall street, it's not any different with the fossil fuel industry or the prison industrial complex. these guys have wealth, they have power and they could care less about the needs of working people in this country, and that's the dynamic of american politics.  spend their money, you know they will tell you that all of them want to research and develop were charged with tackling cancer with tackling diabetes, alzheimer's. the truth is, of course they are, but the bulk off their money is going off into what we call the meat too  stop that, when you're dealing with this kind of influence that you talked about with sixty nine dollars billion in a year i mean the resource? is they have? how would you stop that? well, that is kind of what we call the sixty four thousand questions, yeah and i'll. tell you what i think this is what i believe if you think back on american history and you think about the real changes that have taken place in society. you think about the labor movement and working class people standing up and saying to their employers, we're not gonna, be treated like animals anymore, you can't hire and virus. you can't work us, you know fifteen hours a day, we deserve dignity and you think about the growth of the labor movement of millions of people, beginning to slam together and fight you think about the civil rights movement. you know and  wasn't just dr martin luther king jr was again millions of african americans and white allies say we're going to end segregation and racism in this country about about the women's movement. a hundred years ago, women in america didn't even have the right to vote. think about the gay rights movement think about the environmental. the only way the change takes place is when ordinary people come together and stand up and fight and say that the status quo is not working and that's what i believe and that's what we're trying to do so with the message of  unless millions of people were working with me to tell the corporate elite that they cannot get it all. so how would that be implemented? let's say you become president you're gonna become president. you think we're gonna shut it a shot. president bernie. what do you do you get in there? what do you do? first of all, you make a very clear you make it clear to the american people what your agenda is, and i appreciate the opportunity to talk about an agenda and  or are the most important years for human, intellectual and emotional development right. every psychologist will tell you that, and yet we have a totally dysfunctional early childhood system. you pay. we pay our child  these are issues that we have to deal with and i will deal with him and we are gonna substantially improve the quality of education. america, we're gonna, cancel student debt by imposing a tax on wall street speculation. all right, so you gotta deal with education. you've got to deal with climate change, you know the truth is that donald trump is that wrong. climate change is not a hoax. it is a very, very dangerous reality for our country and the rest of the world signed. this tell us we have less than twelve years to transformer and  if you all going to oppose raising the minimum wage to at least fifteen dollars an hour. i will be in kentucky as president of the united states and we're going to have a rally because you're going to have  pay fifteen dollars an hour to people like that to the entry level, people that they won't be able to stay open well, first of all, they will be competing against. you know if your business number business and both of us to raise our wages at the same level, we both have the same burden. so what's it brett spread across.  kids. these are people in their 30s. these. these are ordinary adults who cannot make it on one thousand two hundred and thirteen dollars an hour. so i think the arg  california, all over this country, is rising fairly rapidly. people can't afford health care can't afford college. i don't think it's asking our employers too much to pay at least fifteen miles an hour minimum itch  loot our water, our air, our environment. it's also not the panty taxes come trump campaign. as i recall he said,  this is their agenda. their agenda was to cut social security, medicare and medicaid and to do away with all corporate texas. so what you have right now, that's that's what greed is about. they want it all. so, as you indicated, you have a company like amazon owned by jeff bezos, who happens to be the wealthiest guy in america worth about one hundred and fifty billion amazon paid zero in federal income taxes, and it's not just them. dozens of corporations paid nothing or very, very little  here you're touching now on the heart and soul of the tragedy of american politics,  i'm worried about the deficit, so you make it  social security checks garnish right now, it's ten to twenty years. it's some places, it's literally a lifetime. now,  own home. you could send your kids to school. you lived a pretty good life made it in the middle class, forty or fifty years later. there's an explosion of technology, there's a growth in unfettered free trade, and it is clear now that most people to make it into the middle class are gonna need a higher education. that's college, or maybe it's technical training in water  world has changed and high school degree is not good enough anymore, so expand that concept through college now guess what  in terms of the cancellation of debt, which is my view. you got forty five million people arm who i  cities, tuition, free, cancel student debt in this country that will cost two dot. two trillion dollars a lot of money over a ten year period. we do this through a tax on wall street speculation, which will bring in two dot four tr.  job that would that would raise more than enough money. it's a very small town.  upped. most of those things are resolved, but not student loans, a man again. this looks through the and that has to do with bankruptcy law, which was passed against my vote on. while you were on bankruptcy- and i should have mentioned this before when you talk about the health care system- one slash, two: a million americans every single year go bankrupt because off medical bill simply can't pay, but right.  they can't in many cases, get married and have kids. they certainly can't buy a home the camp by a call there really crushed by this debt, and what was the crime? what did they do? they try to get a higher education, a  all these people that want action, but nobody knows exactly what to do. there's calls for gun control. this calls for mental health reform. health calls there's calls what, if anything, can be done to stop these things from happening, and how have you sat down  such a horrific situation. you know we were in a way had a town meeting we're in a batter actually in las vegas when el paso happened- and we didn't tell me- and i said, let's take a moment of silence- to remember the victims and pray for the survivors literally the next day- another part of las vegas. i have to do it again and i said i can't believe that just yesterday we did this and i have to do it again. this is, i don't know what the words my friend baidoa rock would say that you don't know what words. what can you say? it happens again and again, who can imagine some lunatic walking into a school or a mall, we're just on a nightclub area taken out of the assault, weapon and shooting people, and that we almost become to accept this is a normal part of american life. is  incredible, is just totally demoralizing all right. so here's what i think, there's no magical answer and but let me tell you what i think. first of all, this is the reality. the reality is that today, as we speak, there are approximately four hundred million guns in america. today we have more guns than we have people we have between five to ten million assault weapons and an assault. weapon, as you know, is a military style weapon designed to kill human beings kind of rapidly. so that's and then on top of that we have again nothing to be proud off, but you know we have a number off mentally unstable people, people  all these ideas, but here's some of what we have to do. first will, if you want to own a gun in america you have got to. we have got to know that you are a stable person, and that means that we need to expand of it it it it the background checks the currently exist. okay, so we got to know. did you beat up your wife? have you committed crimes of it's a treat such? what is the state to be mental health up number two will make that universal number two  can today legally walk into a gun, show up past the background check and buy a dozen guns, walk out and sell them to criminal elements who will use them for bad things.  assault weapons in this country. that's my deal period. s o, i believe, in a ban on a stolen that i think we have got to begin thinking about when we have five to ten million assault weapons, which is more than the u s military has we have to think about it,  into our bill of rights is written into our the the the the the way we the what where this country was founded. it's the second amendment.  right. ninety nine point: nine percent of gun owners would never, in a million billion years, think of doing these horrible things. but in the moment that we are living in a, but i think that we're all going to have to make some concessions to the reality of what is going on, and that is that there is a small number of.  i agree. we are living a terrible situation, i mean there's hundreds of mass shootings a year now, which is insane and if you look at the number in comparison to the rest of the world, it's crazy, like a big one in other countries like three mass shootings in a year we had more than two hundred and seventy it's it's crazy. but how would you implement something like this? well, the idea of banning assault weapons has been done in one thousand nine hundred and ninety four, we banned assault weapons. i believe i believe it was for ten years of  that ben was undone by republican majority uh and it didn't you know, i'm not suggesting by the way than anything here that if you banned assault weapons tomorrow, that will radically change everything, but we have got to do the best that we can do. and again i preface my remarks by telling i don't have a magical solution. you've got hundreds of millions of guns out that you have people who should not be owning these guns who gets set off by god knows what and do terrible things all we can do is the best that we could do. but to say we can't do anything. i think it's a real disservice to the american i'll. tell you something else that bothers me. you know, in addition to the horror of seeing people lying on, the street dead is what this is doing to the children of this country, and i think we underestimate that i have seven grandchildren and in  for them and for kids all of this country, you're, going to see the falls coming. kids, going back to school, you're going to see in schools all over america drills all right. this is what you do if somebody walks into the school all right you,  removing these guns from people's homes? i don't think you're going to have the fbi knocking on somebody's doors and taking it. that's not what we do in america. you know if you have four hundred million guns already out there and they're building more every year. right now, as we speak, gun manufacturers or may  if you are a gun manufacturer and you are selling a hell of a lot of guns to a gun  amphetamines, like adderall and prozac, and all this different stuff that has varied effects on the human brain. what could be done? what  and now i am- and i could understand this perfectly- i'm seeing dayton and i'm seeing watching television, el paso and i'm getting a p t p s ptsd reaction, all right, that's totally. if you were in a place where people were shot down and i'm trying to get counseling,  ford and on medicare medicare would be free. so that's the  including this one. what do you think could be done and what should be done to have this across the especially federal?  possible law abiding person should be able to consume uhm. let me say this when i ran for president's with the democratic nomination in two thousand and sixteen i talked about a broken criminal justice system which ends up having in the united states more people in jail than any other country. we have more people in jail in china does, which is a car  executive order, water, and i will do that. second of all, we have now is number  thing to do. you know we can argue about the pluses and minuses, i'm not a great fan of drugs. other people smoke marijuana a couple of times didn't do much for me. other people, i guess, have different in just a couple times.  you're touching on a real tragedy. yes, and when we talk about criminal justice in america, we have over two million people in jail. they are disproportionately african american, latino and native american and here's what i think i think in the wealthiest country,  it makes so much more sense from a humane perspective. protecting our people,  even the reduced, the all those things sound great the uncomfortable reality about drugs, though, is that when drugs are illegal, criminal, seldom and there's, obviously a need for drugs in terms of not necessarily need, but uh. a demand for drugs is a demand for drugs in this country. that's absolutely fueling mac,  not to know what your heart tells. that's the pharmaceutical industry right. what do the heroin is? legal, yes, art now you're asking this is a very, very deep question, which we don't talk about terribly much. why is it that so many of our people are turning to drugs to alcohol by the way- and i don't mean to drink tonight, but i mean serious alcohol problems  and the job you used to have earning a decent living  it means that we have to have a great educational system and people  up some of the demand for these these illegal. i believe that is the case. look if i am optimistic. if i'm excited about going to work tomorrow and i'm seeing my kid doing great in school- and you know, when i get sick, i can't go to the doctor's office and have a sense of community. my downtown is not all bordered up, because businesses have left, but we have. we have a community yeah, like the strong likelihood is there will be less diseases of this  like there is an out that they do have an opportunity, and  miles long! isn't that great? your point is that we have to. i think, as i understand what you're saying we have to read to find what being a great nation is about. we are not a great nation when we have forty million people living in poverty  with the goal of shutting down plants in this country and moving abroad, and the result of that has been the loss of millions of good paying jobs and the the complete destruction of communal  the control or at least of the direction of the one person who winds up becoming the president united states. is it impossible?  any sane president operates is you need to be working with the smartest men and women from all walks of life who understand the search. every issue we have touched on joe is enormously complicated and i can send out a you know, twenty or tweet on it, but that doesn't solve it. so, unlike trump in a, we will bring together of the best and most knowledgeable people in this country to address the housing crisis. to address the issue of of these diseases of the spare, we don't even touch on climate change. you know, and in the future of the planet, had a week  duration, unlike trumps, is not gonna be filled with billion as who's. you know, basically very often greedy type people. it is going to be filled with the best people from from the working class itself from the trade union movement people who are going to help us create policies that work for workers  resident that can somehow another slow down this this process? first of all, we have to have a president who, unlike trump beliefs and science, that i do and what the scientists are telling us that mention early is that we have fewer than twelve years the transformer energy system, or else there will be irreparable damage done not only child country but to the world. now. climate change is not just an american issue, so we could do tomorrow, all the right things, but of china and russia and india and the rest of the brazil and africa does not do the right thing. you know we're not gonna make the progress we need. so  here is what we have to do. in my view, number one we have to tell the fossil fuel industry that their short term profits and they make a whole lot of money. they're short term profits are not more important than the future of this planet. i don't think that's a hard sell to make. you cannot keep producing a product which is destroying the planet  probably the strongest bro work a record of any member of the congress. so it is not my intention to throw these guys out on the and women out on the street and ignore the pain that they will go through. we are proposing billions of dollars to rebuild those communities and make sure that those guys and women get new jobs, so we're not just discarding people in the fossil fuel industry, but ultimately the product that they're producing, which is now carbon emissions, is destroying the planet. so we have to move away from fossil  aggressively to sustainable energies like wind and solar in california. doing a good job with win die  well these these ideas sound great, but in the competitive environment of global politics. how would you convince russia or china or any of these countries to do something that would put  we're faced with a war in the east with china, a war in the west in europe with hitler.  and see the world with dissent from  deals in europe. alright, just look out the window at what's going on,  thank you to our sponsors. thank you to simplisafe simplisafe, folks round the clock, home security for just fifteen bucks a month and it's fucking off  recruiter and here's the thing you can try it for free for free?

            "transcript": "hello, friends. welcome to the show this episode. the podcast is brought to buy roca sunglasses, i gotta pee  different designs there,  is a fitness tracker that i use. it is the very best fit is tracker. i've ever tried. i wear it every day.  tells you, when you should go to sleep it measures, sleep monitors, how much you recover during your speech, you're sleep and then gives you,  you could be ready, keeping  using just the natural sugars of the wood, no chemicals, and it makes his little pellets  it also has a little meat probe in the application will tell you when the meat hits the perfect goal. it's so simple, it's so easy to cook on and for me i love cooking wild game and i've ever found no better way to make wild game just cooked, perfect and delicious than with a traeger grill  to buy the mother fucking car  but also send ten dollars to our good friend, just in rennes fight for the forgotten charity building wells for the pygmies in congo. so don't forget problem.  you were born during a weird time. that's for sure that is for sure  i agree with you. i don't know, i'm not familiar with it. i know what i said earlier this year. i know that is the issue of only one came from monsieur program called a cold archangel, the archangel project and the archangel twelve. why would a duplicate blind yet again as a person whose very much into were aerial travel as your that's perfect, sprague rate  onto them. but now- and i see little people's kids on what i think of a metallic this'll love package's. yet a love of just use it. you think  see things fight so you're talking about the neural net, you not talking about an actual baby.  what of hydrogen annex and apply them to the subway? i was one of those lay person do try to achieve the same results as he.  that is a eventually we gonna be smarter than us that one day  i am possessions kind away. you down there, they're kind of an attack factor there he'll say: hey billionaire gonna lose stuff like manner stuff. now, what were you gonna do? attack vector, meaning, like people targeted  means from the money that you sell stuff, you could buy new stuff, but do you feel like people define you by the fact that you're you're  in that company, then that that is socially gives you the right to allocate more capital. so it is it's that there's a conflation of consumption and capital allocation, so recycle warren buffett, for example andrea, typewriter motors biggest man, but you know he does like hafela allocation and he reads like a lot of sort of annual reports of companies and the only counting in its pretty boring. really many trying to figure out is dangerous. coke or pepsi deserve more capital. i mean that's kind of warring job. if you ask me, but europe is something that's important figure out like which it is accompanied deserving of more or less capital should that company grower expand, isn't making products and services that are better than others or worsen.  should if africa for companies making compelling parts and services should get more capital and if its not achieved less or gotta business, what there's a difference to recruit between someone who's, making  criticism we should have of, i think fewer people, doing law and fewer people doing finance and more people making stuff yeah yeah. well. that would certainly be better for all involved. they may be  gonna cards on thursdays, stays living, that's for sure you know or making anything really or provide providing valuable service. providing you know, gutter attainment, good information that these rural viable thanks to do so  think about it for a while you're part of it is like, like have wanta houses, but- and i spent a lot of time in most of em and that didn't seem like a good use of assets like somebody could probably being during those houses and get very soon on me, sir punch have jean wilder's house. that's me its autumn. why ask exactly what you expect? did you requested the byron up fuck it up the other requirements of our requirement,  made there like odd shapes and that that there's like doors to nowhere and strangely carter,  this, i said having some privacy issues where we would like, lest we was like come to my house- and you know so- climate of the walls of a fellow man,  dream house, i've thing. what's a dream announced for isla mosque, some tony start type shit dead if we gotta have, but the dough that opens up with us the stealth helicopter, negative yeah fisher, foxier everywhere, but barbaric,  i understand how you can run bore with aboard  like brain cycles. boring company does not take minos like less one percent of re titles and an endless neuro link, which is made us like five percent and then laboratory. let's get chunk future air, we were talking about the last time and you're trying to figure out when it was actually going to go live when it's actually going to be available.  to see what percentage of people's bodies are going to reject these things. is it put it? there is their potential for rejection. it's it's a very low potential for rejection or you can think of it. like people,  that then authentic than say password vice, but it still very double and them that their that there are people have primitive devices in their brands. right now, what kind of us i would like to depress the relation is fighting for parkinson's is that has really changed. she was lives in a big way, which has come our muckle, because, where is kind of like sap,  some of that sort of land that that happen quite a bit after last, some you're here. so what exactly is it? how do you do what what happens? if someone  you won't even know that somebody has and then at the end, so that you can interface basically anywhere anywhere your brain. so it could be something that you know helps cure, say:  it is in principle fix almost anything that is wrong with rain. energy could occur, dumb, restore lompoc malady. so if you ve got to interface into the motor cortex and then implant, that's say that, like a micro controller and near muscle groups you, you could then create survey neural shunt that restores somebody who is a quadriplegic to fall functionality, legal ground, rinaldo, wow,  yeah, advice. working right now is about seven inches in diameter, and you yourselves  even though i swishing nobody i'd like to its great is really fun, so you  be inserted and they will find their way. they tell you i or space tiny wire sailors and they'll find their way to specific areas of the brain to stimulate. no, you literally put them where it witherspoon go. oh, ok,  reverend restoring limb function and eyesight in hearing which are all amazing, zero there. any cognitive benefits you anticipate from some telling us tat. if you could  like that, i don't get it and then went when you when you get older tenter. if you dont like alzheimer just like that, then you lose memory and that this could help you with universal  we are in the soul a lot of work to do so,  it's just i mean once you enjoy the doktor manhattan. lifestyle once wants to become a god seems very, very unlikely. you don't want to go back to being stupid again  sir zadig along for the ride. as a champion of drawing them so  or an ice in beirut. essentially it's just that the data rate to the electronics, a slow so especially up like you just gone with your thumbs. i like what mr data written maiden optimistically a hundred births per second, that's being generous. another computer camp can communicate it like a hundred hundred terabytes sir said. suddenly you get it.  so, even if you can solve that the data rate issue in europe, especially upward but and for two, then you can improve  you arrangements, a lot effort, compressing complex concept into words, and this does little alot. alas, information last that occurs when compressing  words and in different ways and depend upon tone depend.  where you know what a person saying and you can tell them what you are saying  would the sherwood haven't language, but you gotta let what their situation i daresay you would be able to just if we collect the matrix you you want to speak an evaluation of all right. i swear it worth dollar the program right, so  that sounds like that. don't don't worry, that does not mean a sneak of any there's. does this i'll take a well how many years before you have to talk, if the? if, if the development continues to accelerate, then maybe five year,  is or ancient hominid to us. what's the difference less here,  modification of perspective. probably but yeah i mean you, you could save state and restore that state into biological being, if you, if you want to do in future in principle, is like knowing like four  videos on your phone is open away. you could remember video right as accurately as your phone or a camera you know could so i now, if you got like it, some some yet  percent, there's no way to sign a probability with accuracy here right, but roughly, if you just had a just got instinct.  to know that this experience, somehow another doesn't exist in a material form, they can knock on film  there are currently changing your state with love and oxytocin and and beauty changes,  where's my consciousness? what's the line of consciousness and not consciousness between hydrogen in here right, wendy  otto relationships, artificial intelligence, it we'll be unrecognizable that one day will be so  some sort of a direction where you trying to improve things you're out  and you have some my skull cap in place of the top. your head and interfacing, with the  someone if someone exogamy a quote a great quote by a wise person? mace excited  but i hope we will gain whether yeah. that's the thing right gaining more than we lose something it makes us interesting. is that we're so flawed suffer sure electors obligation through the ages  viral immunity so that that's swell  viral inner idea, since that is  see we're smart, but though the minister a capitalist society, you know you could, it seems, like you can run  as like earth? cybernetic collective, that's far smarter than in individual, like i can personally bold like a whole rocket and andy engines and watch it and everything that's impossible, but we have eight thousand people space action by piecing it out to different people and using like computers and machines, and so we can make less rockets launched orbit talk of the space station that anything, so that already exists where this in a way this.  heavy i be vastly beyond us, and de coupled from human will decouple from whom. so this is that, if you can't be them, join them  can, like the animal brain, reptile brain k list for items it. it's like alembic system, basically gothic, the cortex. the brain purist will argue with this definition, but essentially you ve got the primitive rain and you got the sort of fur smart brain or that the rain is capable of planning and understanding concepts and difficult things that a monkey kanner said now the book your cortex  much much smarter than you have existed. nonetheless, they worked gather well, so i've met anyone who wants to lead the loving system or the cortex, the repeal of quite happy having both so near, but that this is being that, like the computer, the eyes it is like a third layer, tertiary lair, so that is like that could be symbolic with the cortex it we much smarter than the cortex, but you'd procession have three letters and an you actually have that right now, your phone is capable of things a yoke, fewer escape of things that your brain is definitely not storing. terabytes of information perfectly doing incredible calculations that we condemn come close to doing you have that  your computer is just like, i said, the data rate is slow. the connection is weak, wizened, so disconcerting a wiser. why does it not give me comfort to think about  you know if you use google voice or lax, or one of the things it using a neural net, to decode your speech and to understand what you're saying, if twenty image recognition or improve the claudia photograph, it's it's using been near. that's the best way to do that,  how do we make sure works? we tried on prisoners like when you do not know if we take rapists, cut holes and have now accept if somebody's gotta search, brain injury rat and though there live like very severe brain injuries than and then you can fix those flows. brain agrees, and you know that you prove out there.  link that says actually that that there would be almost everyone would find a need at some point. if you get old love to use your own your leg and and and then a psycho cancer, we can improve the functionality and improve the invitations communication speed. so then you will not have to use your thumbs to committee with computer.  can a sneak up any others like getting up the approval for staff has not like overnight, and this is an appropriate, had fairly version terrorism before you know it, it would realistically be.  what are we gonna be like when twenty or twenty five  if you're a extension of yourself? what does that mean to you? but when you, when you say i extension of yourself? well, you like said you already have a computer extension of yourself in the moon  it would just be that that more of you would be in the cloud i guess than in your body or if that more of you well  there's so much conflicting information and conflicting opinions about how to proceed.  so it's like watching the same movie again, but in english, so yeah.  yeah. if you, if you're you, can look at the immortality statistics by age and whether they have come, what will come of it? it is likely that, like based existing conditions and age and if you're below, sixty and and have no serious health issues, the probability of death is extremely low besides era, but is extremely low,  quite crazy, but in some places a panic is deserved right like if we only i see you in manhattan and people are dying, left and right, never ones on innovators and its eight  it's like you, have a bow heart disease, yarn and unita triple bypass, it's like sort of elective, but if you don't get it done in time, it's you gonna die yeah, it's collectives where work  still dangerous to worsen the flu, but not as bad as we thought, or we feared it could be  they homework. where mask? does yes not get you back to do them, japan, that's like normal. if you're, if you're ale, you you were faced masking carve on people, i think that that would be a great thing to turn off in general  yes, and i think this has shaken up the the system as such must accept what moribund with. let lays layers of bureaucracy, and i think that you have countries on that bureaucracy and if we have some point, the probably will be a pandemic with with a with it for the high mortality rate.  killing large numbers of young, healthy people that that's you to find. that is like a high mortality than that that this is at least practice were suddenly ban, and i think this has given a steamer maritime that there will be eventually some some such  the pandemic and much more money that goes to funding treatments and in some preventative measures. yeah absolutely- and i think i think this  and attentively. if we act, crackly yeah yeah, the other serve my thinking that there will be some massive lenihan, america of local, more proof of letting than last year, so that the citizens can like a practice, run for something that that had a reputation in the main, the future have a serious like a really high mortality rate in, and we can. i got to go through this with without without it  did i tell you fuck you doing today by police officers who does that who gets it,  even if it comes your way, even if the shitstorm hits you in the face. you got appreciate why? how amazing isn't that all these people do have the ability to express themselves? we didn't  i want to say that it's almost like you know you hit the button.  you know someone say i'm sending opposing smoke signals. there were few your smokescreen mills, it's like it! so crude  you know i mean where they don't realize with. it is something funny about that for everybody else. there is pre great. what might be the best new source?  combine these faces to minimize one perfect social justice more, but the thing i recognized it early on before i met him that this was parity. this is this is just fun and then i love reading the people. they don't recognize that they get angry and they don't really really there's a lot of people are just get really furious, churn out some of the some fun to that this some fun to the not picking up on the true nature of the site,  distance from iridescent like ok, it's well, it's been fired by,  you're looking for what was going on in the world that it's hard to find some man that isn't it. that's that that's good yeah. you know that  and this is so many variables and you gotta put everything through this filter of, whereas this person coming from  bed himself and that world trying to understand it and to be able to report  right now in california, weren't stage to tomorrow or friday, two days from now say to retail stores. opening up things are changing  yes, you know. so it's like that. you got to put a lot of weight on that. have people a lot of people died to you know when the independence with the country and and fight for the democracy that we have, and you know we should treasure that and not in and not give up our liberties to beasley. i think we,  really the wrestling people for protesting, because  living their life, the way they did particulate having a career and  man is stop placing money over human lives and  had this absurd like view that the economy is like some magic corn, aplenty like each it just now,  become detached from reality. do you you can't just legislate money answer and solve these things? if you don't make stuff, there is no stuff, obviously will run out of this.  they did. it turned out to be. maybe i think briefly briefly briefly, but i think if you know any kind of like sensible examination of what happened in china would reach a conclusion that those up sooner can occur this this virus, retreating into on those like two hundred thousand people a day, leaving one so that that it it it went everywhere very fast through throughout china, throughout the world and even fatality  world health organisation appears to have been complicit with a lot of their propaganda that the things that american companies have massive supply chains in china by konrad tessa, for example, we have hundreds of suppliers like tier one, two three, four suppliers throughout throughout china, so we know if they are able to make stuff or not. we know if they. if they have issues are not, then they had their china's back back at full steam and intel. many previous ever use company has some significant ever spies in china sooner. you know if there is a will to provide things were not worth. if, as you know, i mean how they read, it has some thousand people in china so webs  zero people died. ok, so that that's a real statistic: that's coming from yeah! you know yes, people, yet we literally we were in peril. do you think is a danger of this idea?  this has been criticized in both directions really exerts.  center was do this publicly and say we were acting  so somewhere, we helpful just add from informational level, is when reporting serve covert cases to separate out diagnosed with covert versus had covered like symptoms, yes, because of the list of of symptoms that could be covered at this point is like a mile, or so it's like a hard to show it all. it's like you could recover. so just just give you a better information. the deafening diagnosed covered or had covered like symptoms were complaining, those two so that one that it looks bigger than it is, then, if somebody  ethically, not that bad, but heart attack strokes. yet it  in a bind right now that there's a bunch of us preserve their following doctors, as your matching, the other for hospitals have full europe tart heart against me said i ve got like  so my request is covered. only if it is some has been tested has receded a father, pasok, over test not efficient. we have sometimes one of five hundred symptoms and then  is this, because this is  frankly, i am not sure how you die without those things. no, you  i think the way to break out of sloop is to have clarity of information  don't don't love but altogether now and if, if, if you give, if your people just parts out the data better clearer, clearer information about like set, was this an actual curve diagnosis or was it or do they get the test test gave a positive or do they just have some sometimes just parts that those two out and then pass out just if somebody died debate i would today for that they even have a covert test were or today,  were covered with. it isn't had we the main course, but with a significant contributor to their death, or was it not a significant contributor to death.  not every sixty one thousand in this country last year, early, five, solar, well and then their cigarettes massacre.  yeah, it's crazy, so smoke. is it barbicane long suspected? is bad news business not not get near? turning your lungs and smoke smoke? beef, not great. so  acceptable. deaths, are weird and that's the way,  disease, whatever they would have lived x, number years. yeah, you know, sir, you have somebody dies when they're they're there twenty and cut a little eighty. they they last sixty years  way of looking at it. i mean it's unfortunate, it sucks, but it sucks  immune system is, has no problem and an older one has as problem and in fact a lot of it.  in a way, a non judgment away, but likely this is. this is a way that we can all. this is a scientifically proven way that we can boost our immune system and it might save your life and it might save the life of your loved ones, and maybe we can teach this to our grandparents, our parents and  the near hospital. so there was a number one factor for severe covered symptom  it's an art form as well. i find food is it's it's  anything in between as water, coffee actually earl this. this may be a useful verve adviser of her people that  drinking and then going to sleep is he is ass, one of the worst things? yes, so just written,  alcohol and avoid eating at least two or three hours before going to sleep in your quality of life will have your quality of sleep will improve europe general health? one prove line  frank i wouldn't exercise at all, but if ever  you should try something that's fun to do. that's not just like  they get introduced to it because usually either they want exercise or learn some self defence. but then they realise that its essentially like a language with your body later have  so the time that's not real. officially, pay, no more rights to yes, but in the eu have see when hoist gracie offer this ban  the exercise is like you want like, and you want to develop, strengthen conditioning just so they can be better at doing the thing. the analogy that i use is like, if you  we gotta get it those who discovered things. catherine s, work on shore, so deployment everyday takeover bid. services set us back on on progress for the summer months,  so like we gotta get, you know mean retainers and greens taken alike,  with carbon fiber in doing too much interior choices. you go with. you can't fucking  last time you hear you convince made by tesla about it it's  yes, that's it has got it at that time. a guest suspension, sewed lowers the back jesus you're, just like  if i just you know that i went for a couple seconds foreground, citing it's very like having a roller coaster on tap in. it really is like a roller coaster on tat without the looped loops, but it's the painting to you see it seems like you're. not supposed to be able to accept  anyone who's been waiting. they won't be sorry, is there  i definitely swore, but i didn't think the micro pick it up in it it and if it is so like we practice  and we think what happened was that term when we we all went when france hit the birth of the door with this  listen. man have taken up a lot of time. you had a child yeah getting recently. it is amazing that you had the time to come down here, and i really appreciate the appreciate every  he d be attached to just in rennes amazing charity, and he is absolutely one of the best people ever met. my life were really proud that we can help so download  so brought you buy weep and where  find you well much loved you off by ambiguous.

i had a fucking car has never been a guy. that's been cool at a party like you're, better off you're, better off that catches  been awesome. guy he's a totally different human, that's crazy! i had a mamma, my podcast and now that he's retired like one when he was a fighter, you have to kind of be me  with one punch, you have to be that, but what you not do and anymore it's our shared, like this real spiritual guy, he's a vague in need. he does psychedelic sneeze, really intelligent, like real rio's pleasure, to sit down and talk to him, because you realize you see the metamorphosis,  you do know. proudly i woke up to bodies day. do you know i had that huge bodies,  internet authorities are the throttle internet just so many people are simultaneously streaming yet think of how many people are home right now and how many of you  targeting what is holy, fuck joe? what is it this is talk about full confidence. it's it's all netflix  the acres or sound like my arm around. it is my god  i live in south carolina, that's gonna, fuckin, nine wives, who he  this is russian due to think who has a polar bear swims at the polar bear.  because i think your body probably doesn't think you need to be chasing things and killing things because you're not eating animal protein, so bodies like just relax and strolled just pick berries and grasses and stuff. you know, i think, if you do the same thing too,  now imagine it was a bear. the did that just a responsibility, little length of its next so crazy. if such long necks but the just what it is it's it's. you know that the animal that it is it seems ridiculous ishmael to have that in your backyard.  like you see the john jones or someone else who had a mood, i know john has some big cats. he took his gaze warmer.  but they're not gonna, go crazy. cat noises thing was making what savings fine servile cat growling while eating one on the environment, to talk to us all time  interested in detail, she saw bird and then it was locked in o locked  bunch, babies, unwanted babies, you write absolutely, but the idea,  dogs balls, you're, changing with the dog as and you can do that my point was you can do that with dogs or you can not do that with dogs like you can have dogs that have the test with, but with cats you have  voting. a cat is falcon when you show just how weak your he so little to he wasn't a big cat. at the time you wasn't even a year old in august was gettin a fixed, so i think you're gonna fix, like  might fall the airline, even with a lot of you, my father, might jump on you bite you and you might freak out. spaz like a cat, is freaked out for its life up and treat it does not get down here. they might, they might fuck em. i caught you sued  we'll get to know each other as a kind of shit. you things you doing, you're twenty seven.  catalonia. that's my grandmother who was working gray, get trained plains of automobiles one. you can this other cat that it had from the time when i was like twenty five and that cat was caught in the city.  you know. if there are real friendly with everybody catarrh their trip, you have to fix them. that was my point. is a dogs you can have a dog that has balls and their bright, like my dark, partial he's, great aggressive at all. in these three he's he's seems like a fucking cooled unease the sweetest he's the sweetest, but  think about it. like my wife, my wife lived on her grandmother has a bar like big farm and there's always cats, urban  soda on my shirt. am i lose sisters tat at the time? she is you.  start over. i loved him he's a sweetheart. he can just. it was a real sad watching him age, because that, at the end he couldn't walk, and i just have to pick him up and bring him in the house to eat and then i'll carry him outside again see if he had to go to the bathroom. but he was at a certain point. is life  based on our planet. rude dog does our place,  there is also there was some speculation about tamiflu, but i don't think there's any conclusive evidence. it shows a term of flu helps it, but there is some these anti malaria medications. i think that they think has promised, but  yeah everywhere were hearing about his all over the planet. i think that was the case back door and spanish flu days. i think, was probably harder to understand what was happening right because it will probably only got the newspaper in the  fine and meanwhile they knew they knew so they are two faces. they are a public face there given to us  that the coronavirus is going to wreck our economy. if they knew that it was coming down like a fucking storm of hail, that no one could stop if they knew, and then they bailed out and made amends profits.  dump the stock that those can be a little problem without be ok more, but if they found i was gonna, be huge problem. then it's not will. that seems weird to me too  make sure most bad like that's by birth. is them the ultimate real? because if it's supposed to be about confidence and things rising and falling dislike the ultimate expression of that  who are paycheck paycheck, you know with white and tables or teaching spin glasser whatever it is. i that's where my brain goes is like how come by there's gonna be wait if i can help people  from having a great place, we can go on and count on x amount of money per week to all sudden gone, and no one saw common. that's never happen ever. you can't blame them for not being prepared, but you know their part of  new york city, those guys fucking apartments,  does that was the one where they film, those hbo specials with rodney, dangerfield, ia and  got in this guy. the backers anything ran on stage is a faggot, and i didn't have one pull out. i just went far common. that would you be prepared for  the one thing that we need a new era of always was a newbie say this and i ve always i kind of written you off about a goin like well. you know what ever you gotta get off, that blood pressure medicine near the second  male came in. he could die delicate when guys drink a lot and they stop drink. it's really bad. apparently, that's what killed amy. why now stay apt?

            "transcript": "from the new york times. unlike other borrow, this is  middle of march, though, so here's what we're watching breaking news louisiana officially, can become the first state to postpone its democratic primary election over the corona virus pandemic, and it becomes clear that the corona virus global health pandemic has really up ended. the race completely after super tuesday states.  even as public health officials are urging them and states across the country have taken that drastic step. it was concept in what explains what's happening in wisconsin, but when most people look at these presidential primaries particular state like was content. they think that this  there is not really ravaged state in the same way that we have seen in other parts of the country at the end  and that's why they proceeded with the primary, and i want to give credit to govern rivers. i agree with  and the governor issues a stay at home order, like many other governors did across the country and close, it's all non essential businesses. it's not something i wanted to do, and it's not something i'd take lightly and people across the state are starting to say. but if we can't leave our houses, how are we supposed to vote brain and what's the answer the governor and state republicans keep holding this lie that voting with something that was so essential that the primary with something that was so important  creative measures there is an increasing fear, particularly among pole, workers, that the election will be unsafe for them to stand,  the local jurisdictions do is closed and limit their polling locations. some of the more drastic examples include milwaukee the biggest city  alice to every single registered voter living in wisconsin state would now  is that every person would be mailed. a ballot  postage and mail. it out to three point: three million people in wisconsin is completely made up, but also a kind of morally and democratically wrong that happen. sometimes, i guess, if a thumb you're feeling pressure from one in your own special interests or from the party themselves, but unduly deceivers, no,  without going in person. i urge legislators to take this call for a special session seriously. it does it go where the legislature gobbles an accession. this  guns, do not grant the governor his wish for a male and bounding system right  there is no issue in which that can be left aside.  browser extension, backed by paypal, pal that scans, the internet for the best promo code and automatically ataturk, heart cart, just download honey to your computer shop like normal click, the apply coupons button and watch the prices drop, its one huh  do they tell us what's happening on the ground wherever they are,

does we have to do it and will stand as way here we are suggesting is a different approach to these tests and we  only some of them catch up to the hairs, but then what is that done now? it's harder for law schools to decide which students to admit back when i was preparing for the el said over the edge tech, company, noodle,  maybe the top schools or almost join from the pool above the one hundred and sixty seven mark, but if the test allows the tortoises to score high,  privileges tortoises over the hairs now the jeff sutton's of the world get a perfect score. gotta, harvard law, school and justice scully breathed a sigh of relief, except, if you do it that way, the hairs get discouraged,  it was basically only ire from the top fourteen and the top fourteen only have room to admit forty five hundred students a year in total. fifty three thousand people are competing for forty five hundred slots. it's crazy! i'm a graduate of the university of toronto.  the british columbia. i second crown jewels. fifty two thousand,  object on the outset began when i ran across a paper on assess all run by a guy named william henderson. we met him in the previous episode, the former fire fighter from cleveland who now teaches law at indiana university. well, henderson told me to call a friend of his named evan parker. they worked together. i dont know if you ve ever read michael louis, his famous  it is one hundred percent puckers young cerebral, very proper in a suit tie briefcase. is that messing around? i said at the beginning that i was going to offer you a grand, unified theory of how to fix higher education. i'm almost there pucker analyzes who the successful people are at any law firm and then works backwards and asks is the firm hiring the kind of law school graduate? who is most likely to become a good lawyer? he has multiple data points, regressions, algorithms and he finds they dont higher the right kind of law school graduate. what is the efficiency that is the perfect worded is a market  efficiency firms have plenty of information about prospective hires resume grades law, school work experience, but parker finds they dont know how to make sense of it. people go for a short cut. instead, you end up selecting people who are like you, not people who are like the successful attorneys. at your firm view, my colleague is call it the mirror, autocracy  getting higher individual scores where she less likely to stay puckers method. is  situation, the situation you need algorithms and data to make sense of it, and now we come to the heart of the issue  the numbers. tell us really doesn't matter and we like to serve  who excel at that certain kind of thinking get into the top law?

where does that come from? i think that  that dna comes directly off the heels of the fox news clip at the end of blood. thus, dna feels like a direct response to that criticism. whi kendrick would choose to respond to fox news.  kendrick is going to let them know and then so. here on dna, i don't like it. i get i get  not everybody. seventy eight that his faith of kendrick lamar king kendrick, lamar, king kendrick, innovative and so at the conclusion of good kid. mad city kendrick establishes the  loyalty got royalty inside my dna comes as a direct response to the fox news critique we here just before these lines, it would seem that the mockery of his music has kendrick feeling defensive  legacy of gang affiliation has filled kendrick with tendencies that are both positive and negative, and to this  selecting attributes seem to have been present since birth, with one like this, give the gift that i kendrick says. i was born like this, since one like this immaculate conception, he  this. of course, stands in stark contrast to kendricks conflicted family heritage, we discussed previously  claiming himself. yes, you are jesus's. new weapon implies that kendrick views himself as an instrument in service of god.  shares this message by offering all of himself to his listeners. this provides insight to why he's beginning damn with a detailed account of his blood of his dna and all of its flawed complexities's dna continues. kendrick plays off the word weapon wrapping. i don't compton plate. i meditate then off your fucking head this that put the kids to bed having just claimed to be an instrument for the teachings of jesus who he know, preach nonviolent self, sacrificing forgiveness. these lines come as a bit of a surprise. by definition, contemplation refers to the thoughtful observation of external environment, while meditation  psalms to be a way in which one can turn away from wickedness and be blessed quote. blessed is the man who does not follow the advice of the wicked or stand in the path of sinners or sit in the seat of the air  today, students that come from under resource communities lack access to technology and connectivity. they need to succeed, and if we,  as someone who has a very specific style preference of a somewhat sceptical about someone else, selecting my clothes. for me, i stop  create your style profile and schedule. your first fix today by visiting stitch, fix dot com that stitch fix dot com. welcome back to dissect before the break we discuss. dna is first few measures. there were her  rich is built into my dna here. kendrick seems to be claiming that his life is real by virtue of his tendency to kill as kendrick dives deeper into his instinct, stored violence and greed. we here for the first time, evidence that wickedness has produced great suffering, even within his body. he says i got dark. i got evil that rot inside my dna.  so why did i we can train from london with simmons st with gary rankin? make me killer nic of record in me based on these tracks in past interviews, we don't know whether kendrick actually personally murdered someone or just feels responsible for the murder either way. the guilt from kendricks troublesome past has left him with a troubled heart.  just when they when they get use the. i know what you just so you use it kendrick wraps i just win again did win again like wimbledon. i, sir, can you accuses the image of a tennis match to describe this conflict with an unnamed opponent he's off the tennis term? winner  pairing it sengen to a bird as a reference to the whistling sound from turbo engines, while fireworks likely refers to the flames emitted from shorten exhaust pipes. we should also note, in this passage the change of perspective kendrick sneaks in he begins by saying i win again, but then in the corvette lines, he switches to the  kendrick. then moves on to further dismember his opponent. rapping problem is all that sucker shit inside your dna, daddy, probably snitched heritage inside your dna backbone, don't exist, born outside of jellyfish  i'm self and you i know yeah yeah, yeah kendrick wraps see my pedigree most. definitely don't tolerate the front. should i been through probably offend you. this is paul as old as  in this specific line, saying quote, i can't tell you the shit i've been through.  at this point, we should remember that dna began as a response to fox news. we also recall that  instead share of trauma growing up in compton said the he documented on good kid. mad city we might speculate. kendrick suffers from some form of ptsd himself as a link. the verse of dna continues. kendrick explores this child to  states my expertise- checked out in second grade. this is likely when kendrick was seven years old. the year he became an older brother when talking about his childhood in interviews. kendrick is  have to come in a grips too, the idea of knowing who man man was, you know as a seven year old boy in freaking out who they see as kendrick lamar. you know an taking all of these different aspects and personalities from my own perspective, for me, for my soul and putting them into record. ok  sighted children illustrates how was wealth is allowed him to recover a part of childhood. he never enjoyed due to his family's financial hardships. kendrick  chooses to surround himself with people. he may still feel antagonistic in isolated. kendrick continues an excellent mean the extra work and absent nis. what the you heard and pessimist never struck my nerve  here nazareth refers to jesus of nazareth. pleading his case likely refers to the trial in which jesus played innocent of false accusations. it's unclear what jesus trial has to do with kendrick until we consider the next line.  remote is parts of the earth unquote. this, of course, adds substantial context to the lines. the reason my powers here on earth, according to jesus, the holy spirit, is the power that comes down from heaven to his followers on earth kendrick among them. moreover, jesus  either true or false. this is why jesus clarified that the spirit he sent down to his followers was the spirit of truth quote when the comforter comes, whom i'll send you  phil about it since day, one the higher power that kendrick refers to is likely the same spiritual power of truth that jesus promised to send his disciples. so we can see how  this is why i say that hip hop is done more damage to young african americans and racism in recent years. in the midst of the chaos we here emerged, the voice of fox  gambling in which players roll three dice. these kinds of dice games are popular with an urban black culture, and references to dice games run throughout the history of hip. hop  crime and violence caused by dice games. kendrick's assertion that he's rolling several dice further associates. kendricks dna with the subversive heritage of urban hip hop culture. at the same time, rolling dice could be alluding to good friday the day that kendrick released, damn after the trial that found jesus to be guilty. the same trial kendrick just reference at the end of verse. one soldiers were given orders to execute jesus by hanging  this is i rate reaction to her all those comments about hip hop as the chaos of the bridge leads to its climax, kendrick recites, a powerful couplet. let's have another list  it's in harmony and three six mafia. the triplet flow has seen a recent resurgence in popularity, particularly in trap. music spear  flight that made alan shepard, the first american to reach outer space.  audio editing by eric bassen me original theme. music by bureaucratic you can now "

            "transcript": "welcome to dissect long for musical analysis broken into short digestible episodes. i'm your host call krishna today.  he's looking for. rather, we find him embracing the chaos of his life in a celebration of uncertainty and anthem of ambiguity. the subject of today's episode,  wanted to maybe use woods the sample. i was like yes, a week later there are more murmurings, and eventually i just got on the phone with kanye. we ended up talking for a half hour,  i have bear so i added some choir sounding stuff and then sticking out the samples with my voice that whole first week i was there. we worked on the wood song, which is called lost in the world, were just eating breakfast and listening to the song on the speakers and he's like fuck. this is going to be the festival closer. i was like yeah cool. it kind of freaked me out. unquote. vernon ended up visiting the hawaiian studio on three  to slow down the time connie pitches up woods, one semitone for lost in the world  just tell vernon, does this beginning with that solo voice for time sake, i'm going to play these passages a little faster than they appear on the song  burning goes all in from what i can decipher that something like  because these types of harmonies, but it's certainly not common practice, especially in the hip, hop or pop song, these harmonies process through audit to make for a unique unit of retro and future the time. this is that the human voice, the computer ice perfection of bands, technological it  begin to see and, of course, a dramatic leap up to a g room. it's also interesting to note that saying i'm up in the woods  this opening vocal section on lost in the world is one full minute and contains three repetitions of the four vocal phrases, but i'm boney various woods. this vocal part is repeated eleven times lasting nearly five minutes, and this in itself is a form of text painting, as the repetitiveness of the lyrics make.  nation ship and about with mononucleosis hepatitis. vernon left north carolina for wisconsin, ultimately spending the winter alone in his father's cabin in the  a situation parallel, each other in many ways as connie self imposed exile, him search  the lyrics of woods, altering them to read, i'm lost in the world been down my whole life, i'm new in the city and i'm down for the night connie retains a duality. in contrast, the original lyrics were built on  these feelings of helplessness and insignificance for his part. connie offers a solution of his own with the lines that follow, i'm new in the city and i'm down for the night. these lines imply a new beginning, a fresh start in the face of the existential hopelessness of being lost in the world. carnies conclusion is to simply live in the moment, embrace the unknown the new city and be down for the night. we'd be hard pressed to find a moment on. the album is cathartic as this one perhaps match only by runaways anthemic hook. position here on the albums, closing lost in the world's chorus and so much of triumphant celebration of hardships overcome is the triumphant embrace of letting go, relinquishing total control and coming to terms with ones on circumstances, lawsuit.  work continues with the brief instrumental bridge that will circle back to later in the show. after this bridge, the hook is performed again, followed by connie's only verse of the song. i have been yeah my question yeah, my stress as connie tells it. the conception of this first began as an email that turned into a pile  and i had this song playing over and over and over several years down the wire everything i just had that bond with their sample playing armstrong figure out. if you have approach because it it was so much faster than the rest of dark fantasy it. i don't really know how to how to get on air flow and share it. you know, and then i just got it wrote this  i was so happy at that. it worked on that song on you know los in the world like we're, not always in the position that we want to be at were constantly growing, with constantly making mistakes because they trying to express ourselves are trying to actualize our dreams. an you know that song was the first step or a second separate third step  displayed on lost in the world. is that love, and perhaps life itself is best experience when you embrace inherit duality of the universe. when you accept the negative, because you know, without it, it's impossible for positive to exist,  tip of heaven, the daodejing, the essential dallas tech, says quote. if you want to become whole, let yourself be partial. if you want to become straight, let yourself be crooked. if you want to become full, let yourself be empty. if you want to be reborn, let yourself die if you want to be given everything, give up everything unquote throughout twisted fantasy connie's struggle with the principle of duality trying to reckon or take control of the conflicting forces in his life and, like we mentioned last in the world, is the embrace of letting go and in that resignation is where growth and harmony reside. if you want to be reborn, let yourself die if you want to be given every  a path of self actualization, as connie mentioned in the interview we heard earlier that freedom also result in tangible action away  so mark you stop by money dibango. my my michael jackson, interpolated mock  play mister each reach. we have to consider the way connie performs this song live  run for your life here we find connie for the first time directly, opposing and literally running from the life of celebrity he's been attempting to make sense of throughout the album he coins it plastic and fake.  celebrity and fame in order to find himself in order to be loved and be loved. this notion calls back and gives deeper meaning to the song's hook, specifically the lines i'm new in this city, i'm down for the night. yet again we quote the daodejing. if you want to be reborn, let yourself die if you want to be given everything give up, everything is cognis, leap of faith is letting go and embrace of chaos is a means to find order, and it's interesting now to think back. on the other time connie quote  as you remember, this passage came after. he spoke of his diamond encrusted piece or handgun, as well as the passage in which she speaks of wylie chasing women  connie has grown through his experiences. he shared on the album, as we said many times a season. two  ready to the situation, but then also what i learn. there's no reality to celebrity and because of everything that i've been through is led me to the point to be able to be an it way. more expressive. artists deal with way more reality. you can't take anything away from me at this point. canceling too i was talking with lady gaga. i miss you. i was going to have like you know, i'm saying like  can you take away from me and that's what i'm saying about any media, any person that writes it? i think, without you know, releasing all the fear and all the what if this happens, i wouldn't have been able to make the runaway film.  and, of course, we first think of the lush and layered vocals of the album's opening track.  about midway through lost in the world. a distorted, snarling, synth bass enters a tone. we've heard on all the lights  loss of the worlds bridge features tribal drums that are converted to conga drums when the song switches over to who will survive in america.  finally, in perhaps the most obvious and purposeful sonic callback is a tribal chance to enter at the end of lost in the world  these two engineers also recorded the chance that appear on lost in the world, which, of course, six  our lens grows wider. still we're getting invocations of the beginnings of man, a timelessness, an agent wait. it adds grandiosity to the closing of an album, already full of grandeur, of fitting finale for a work of this ambitious magnitude. but perhaps more importantly,  last time, the harmonization of humanity reminder that, however, diverse and divided we become were all a part of the same human race were all related and can therefore relate to one another  humanity is gone. what do we give to even this little planet? you know that we're all and what could we do collectively they remove it.  is essentially a musical setting of an abridged version of gil scott heron comment number one. the spoken word piece written in nineteen. seventy!  past, serves as a prophetic prognosis of the world we live in today. as speaks on the unfulfilled promises of america and the american dream specifically for people of color, it's a dream that kanye black, rich and famous as fulfilled more than most. of course, kanye stream is felt  miss connie feels he speaks the truth, regardless of its consequences and now finds himself in a position where the truth he spoke put in jeopardy. everything is accomplished,  it's only here at the end of the track that connie chooses to extract this question out of context and then inserts it towards the conclusion of the peace  fighting for legalized smoke or lower voting age, let slip from his generation gap and bucking in the street. where is my parallel to that? all i want is a good home in a white and her children and some food to feed them every night that goes pale face to basics this little off, and then they have a natural. do struggles. kings, make him a refugee from mandingo. what does webster say about soul? i say you silly trade motherfucker! your great grandfathers had a ball and chain to my balls. it involves me through a cotton field. while i lived in an unflushable toilet bowl- and now you want me to help you overthrow what the only issue that can be there, what does webster say about soul?  build a new route to china to place a piece in a new context. is one thing, but to me, cherry picking. two sentence is out of context to create an answer to a question that is completely different than the original. well  you know lost in the world like when i always in the position  in the plastic life is outlined on lost in the world in search of something real. this line is also a clever call back to the opening line of the peace living as we do upside down. trying is use, metaphor  unique rose and no crackers and the question posed by both heron and barack i was under.  hungry, for

 dr ninety percent of the company's revenue ex cofounded the company in two thousand six reach. twenty three went public two thousand eighteen. its market cap is now around twenty five billion.  that running a company that's become so valuable. i am actually very little folks,  depending on your personal perspective. spotify is either an idealized digital jukebox poor as ready  these days he spends about one week a month in new york, but he still lives in stockholm. yeah and i have  really thought he was really cool south. i'm ok! well, he must know something. so i learn how to play the guitar  new computer, which was subsidized by the government. i have this broad band that was subsidized by the governments  a piece of software that let a user like daniel ek, download, music files directly from the hard drives of other napster users all over the world, which meant that if one person bought a cd to onto their hard drive and shared a napster napster, all the sudden, an infinite number of people could own it for free one problem. this is an infringement of copyright and totally illegal, at least in most places, sweden  so easy to access and the alternative was for me to go out and buy a record with money at in the house  sense of a very broad music education and quite eclectic tastes, which in turn got me even further into music. i mean, i don't think i would have been that interested in music if it weren't for piracy. to be honest because, like i come from a working class family, we couldn't afford all the wreckers that i wanted,  which found that illegal downloads, in fact it almost nothing to affect music sales, they wrote. our estimates are inconsistent with claims file. sharing is the primary we,  two hundred million people who are participating in the economy who bought records  i definitely think so. i mean in hindsight they probably realised that it was the wrong thing, but they thought by shutting down that they contain the problem, didn't realize  it had taken apple awhile, but they finally succeeded in negotiating the rights with record labels. daniel ek, meanwhile, was having a lot of success himself. yeah yeah, i started like web design companies web hosting companies than a bunch of different companies. you actually started doing this work when he was fourteen by the time he was eighteen  forbes magazine, i was deeply uncertain, of who i was and who i wanted to be. i really thought i want to be a much cooler guy than i was moved into a cabin in the woods back nears family. he play guitar meditated in overtime, thought up the idea for spotify, of whose very simple really  just religiously feel like everything should be free? we were never that john parker definitely was never that either sean parker, as in the co founder of napster parker leader, provided some venture capital to spotify. there's the other.  and i was kind of dismissive about the whole idea. then he told me the name of this programmer and this guy  torn. i really know what to do with it, so we persuaded him to sell you torrent to us instead and the whole idea from the begin was actually two fold. it  it was more around like how do we solve a real problem? and i think that the problem that we  they would have been fools not to remember. the music industry was in steep decline thanks to changes in technology, economics and consumer preferences as daniel.  by making relatively skinny payments to the people who actually made the music there. royalty statements were made.  they were starting to go under, spotify was offering a lifeboat and fairly luxurious one. seventy percent of streaming revenues and an equity stake in the company, the big record label- sony, universal and warner were reportedly each given between four and six percent.  your wannabe, yes sure, yeah, it's music copyrights generally  in the u s was thousands of different radio stations and internationally was like multiplied by ten acts is like a pretty big thing and then,  yeah the supplies infinite says. in order to stand out, you have to do quite a lot more and where we  by maybe being specialist in a certain john, her there now finding equal opportunities to get their music heard.  to their artist correct, you have nothing to do with it. i wouldn't which we have with nothing to do with that. what we are trying to do, however, because this is such a dramatic shift in an economic model for artists, one of the big things, which is: how do we educate people about this,  revenue ecosystem are not really because you know the common complaint is. this. spotify is great for customers. re spotify has turned out to be a lifesaver for labels. spotify has been great for spot, a fine for you and it's been great for some musicians, but then there are others who feel that their worse off than they would have been now every cases little bit  is again to st peak of c d. all of those different things are estimates is dead. there were about twenty two may be thirty thousand artistic live on being recorded music artists. now they could be touring, they could be doing other things in the number can be far greater than that, but their only  do listen to a lot more music than you did before and lit listen to big a diversity of artists than you did. the form which  comparing the music industry to the modern economy. at large, both cases he argued most of the earnings were going to fewer and fewer people at the top of the pyramid is what some people call tournament model where the winners get most, if not all, of the profits krueger died recently in age, fifty eight by suicide, he left behind a book to be published soon called rock economics in it. he rate said there are roughly two hundred thousand professional musicians in the. u s today, accounting for point. one thing  men, creativity, by enabling a million artist to be able to live off their art? this was one of the great promises of the digital era that you wouldn't have to be a superstar to make a living. in two thousand and six, the journalist chris anderson, published an influential book called the long tail why the future of business is selling less of more daniel act in two thousand and ten  rate of point four cents per play, its nearly thirty three million dollars going to drakes camp. but the pyramid is shark and things fall off really fast when she go beneath the top alan krueger sites and industry survey, which found that just two,  has recently been valued at more than thirty billion dollars in two thousand. thirteen. its valuation was just eight point, four billion dollars, other  companies worth orison or, if that's fair, there there's something called a wall street.  once a day works fast and lasts all day turn europe.  i would like us to see ourselves and be ourselves: get ready to open up top, laugh even cry with our sweet. should a  would seem to be figuring out away to derive more value, more revenue from the massive sprawling ecosystem of recorded music and eco,  focuses ass much on subscription income as a dozen advertising and hbo  none of that market is about bollywood films,  the middle of the long tail there would be a step up here be out. while i mean it's virtually non existent, so it's in a much earlier development stage, then the? u s, music economy. let me ask about consumer,  by not having to spend more than ten dollars to consume the universe of music where that dispose  flexing videos and you can listen to that entirely for free, that's war were competing against. so in order to do that, you can imagine, then it's a free product, verses, one, this ten dollars a month.  harmful to streaming music, because now my eyes are free to do something that might be more interact right. i mean you may be right  asian or music. what wellness music sleep, amino pink noise, white  you're making a choice whether they will have an audio service of their choice, and so it  and now we're probably not the biggest the second biggest audio books service in germany an end. this is without our involvements, mete out. this just happened by proxy, thus being a platform.  the reason. why is really twofold? some one is, i think that the format of podcast we're still very very early on  so, if apple podcast data existed in a non closed environment,  he became alarmed sometime april? may, i believe, last year and obviously  if we do monetize it. yes, if you do monetize, how well do you and yet we we monetize. some of those aspect, of course, like in any normal at platform, is very important, though, to note that we're not selling any customer data, that's what i'm asking are that suits others ads on the spot. five, yes, i'm out you'd be fools not to  the data in order to make the spot of experience better.  lots of different companies before i really wanted to see what would happen if i plied myself to one thing in only one thing and do it for a meaningful amount of time. how far i could get on that problem and the long  my role have to look like in order for me to be addressed at a key component. how interested you can remain, and i mean it needs to be kind of constantly challenging to tat that roughly so i mean to be honest, because otherwise, if you don't have the passion and  was that the music industry would take care of all the other things, how people get sign, how they get heard, and i realized that that  today, the primary tool that aid an artist has to get heard on spotify. besides putting the music on there is getting  translate into money for the rights holders so having that power is important, especially from a profit maximizing perspective, if  then you know a lot of really cool must be so cool to launch a new place as a means for you guys to discover what the music, oh yeah for sure and there's like a lot of things that you just don't even know about. so that's like been four made. the biggest thing of the last year has been really interesting and then on the pot cast side. i you know. is it such a fastening form,  in the spot, if i music library, that you really want to fix, there are, but obviously, by now the holes tat we  never done that, it cannot goes against the ethos of what is were trying to do  the music industry has to be disrupted. i believe it has to be evolved, so we like to work with them as partners on. that's always been our approach. there isn't music on spotify that the copyright owner haven't authorized us.  lay. why am i not to save lives, and what would i do if i did that, and i think in our talks about this technology currents- and i think in  so the  if you want to learn more about spotify, including how a team of swedish social scientists tried to reverse engineer it to see how the platform really works took out. a new book called spot, a fight,  in history, if you know you're banana history, you know this happened before. can the banana be saved again its next time and for economics radio,  facebook and linked in worthy email that radio for economics that come. we also play "

 so there's two weeks ago, interest rates ruddy very low. we just for a war against  ah, when we really need it, we could spend money. normally, you wanna have big blow out in recessions to support the economy.  they go down for a while. now the thought is, of course, that assumes everything  advice for people. yes, i very specific advice: don't touch it one of the basic findings from economic says: you can think them all  i've, twenty nine plan, your kids college tuition and their already deepened highschool, then a third.  whom probably knows more about working from home, then just about anyone you'll ever meet, not just because he's a professor and not because he's lazy, but because he has studied this very question.  making processing data on computers, so they were kind of individual working jobs. they were thirteen percent more productive. i mean  so that's why you can be a home for a five day week. the second point was off the end of the study. they then ask.  this leads to health issues more generally,  hence i think another thing it's gonna be damaged in the lower and actually is, if everyone's working from home there's not gonna, be that kind of what place discussions com  gee, that's very organised that can deal with change that inspires their employees. they can survive this by think chaotic disorganized bomb could literally fall apart and about already we start to see bankruptcies daughter had up. is there anything you can point to that? really good leaders  toys to feel like somebody's there. that cares about massages there that it may mean that manages gonna lose frankly dinner, three four hours a day on these one or more meetings, but i fear, without that they could alias contact and the employees could become caught, certainly depressed and lonely. well, it's the same argument. the people had with the school closing sounds very costly to close a school people work. now. what do you do with your kids? the kids aren't learn,  america. we have a lot of meetings and many people feel that those meetings are beyond not productive but actually  and most people in the next you know period a time weeks months are going to be commuting a lot less one  you know once people are ordered to work from home and then they all of a sudden there not having to come. you they're not having to tuck in  education, work with schools and universities suddenly shifting to our mind teaching- and if you are  i was pregnant someone, those i oh when our hair, when i was in labour, i was like i was having a orgasm grow airs go now, some of you now somewhere baling. maybe  a career of studying, behaviors, the most economists than think much about including addiction, and what did becker argue  will allow people like you to measure the efficacy of remote teaching. so can you envision actually doing that study or someone doing that study? what kind of data would be needed? what kind of time frame would be useful cetera you may come,  remote learning here, i'm not the optimistic that remote  in the best interest or in the interested all of anyone to actually study and come to that kind of conclusion. yes, absolutely, i think your eyes, economists, yours one progress, so imagine- professes- can suddenly teach much more efficiently by recording a class once than have  of and timely, it is to attend. college should go to four years worth of college. i've been shocked at how low the take up rate.  you know whether its writing, an english, i say or writing a poem or yeddo, coming up with a computer program that the euro does acts or yellow thinking about how to price some obscure private equity firm that  see their questions you see, confusion, sometimes use  there's no reason i need to fly to the east coast. you know many times a year to give talks. why can't we just do remotely? i think this will give us the opportunity to  saucy eyes and entrepreneurs. if part of this  be how changes in the environment shape, arrange a few malcolm's health outcomes, economic outcomes, livelihoods. more broadly, can you talk for second met your  put people in a room and turn up the temperature. you can pick them off, even if there's no one else in the room, but patterns of social engagement,  absolutely interesting to measure, i would think most of the measures being put in place to reduce them  nasa published some really startling photos of changes in air quality over china. chinese add, you know, taken  really bad for health outcomes, and so any reductions in air pollution are gonna, be good on average for health outcomes. there were  all of this had a really dramatic effect on air quality are clearly improved by about a third and the span of just a couple months, and this was all temporary suspension and correct. this was temporary suspension  prudence in air quality across the u s and people  did much everywhere, or is it mostly in the places where covert nineteen was particularly concentrated.  serve no decline in air pollution. around beijing sort of ironically, are so tell us what you believe  so far there have been around three thousand lives lost to cover nineteen in china that never continues to grow up at go up much more slowly. china seems to have really turned the corner on this, so it's about you know twenty times, fifteen to twenty times higher the debts,  another minute on the silver lining? i'm curious about other behavioral responses to covet nineteen in china, so air pollution fell enough to have a big positive effect. transportation is a substantial contributor to air pollution. so did transportation fall enough to lead to maybe a big drop in traffic?  he's such an economist there's a global pandemic going on, and he is finding this silver lining in this gigantic black cloud that your identifying, what might be let's say, forty five thousand fewer deaths in china because of less air pollution versus  all the other negative consequences that a large pandemic like this would have on health system, and i think that's right  large everyday actions, so i guess ideally what you'd want to think is, after the recovery from this pandemic, what you'd have as policymakers look at you  that you know, god willing. the pandemic turns out to be less fatal list  i'm curious about what curiosities you may have to what kind of lasting effect you may want to look  hoping you and your loved ones. even your enemies stay healthy, and if not that they can get the care they need, that's all  stitches.
